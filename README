Matthew's Flask Skeleton
========================
This is a simple skeleton for Flask applications. It assumes that you want
to use Flask with Flask-Script. The application layout that it sets up is
fairly bare-bones, and doesn't include any databases, forms, or other fun
stuff by default.

It does, however, provide tooling for ep.io, in the form of an example
`epio.ini` and a launcher called `epio_launcher.py`.

To get started, just:

1.  Copy this somewhere.
2.  Rename `myapp` to the package name of your app.
3.  Change the package references in `manage.py` (also `epio.ini`).
4.  Edit the README and LICENSE files as appropriate.
5.  Add any extensions or packages you want to use to `requirements.txt`.
6.  Run `sh bootstrap.sh` to set up your virtual environment.
7.  Hack away!
